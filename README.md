# Cyberpunk RED Wizards

A Foundry VTT module for **Cyberpunk RED** that adds a step-by-step **Character Creator**, an **NPC Generator** with a statblock importer and custom-template editor, and an in-game **Store** for buying equipment.

Requires the [Cyberpunk RED - CORE](https://gitlab.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core) system and the [socketlib](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-socketlib) module.

## Character Creator

A guided wizard that walks players through the full character creation process from handle to gear.

![Character Creator](docs/character.png)

**Three creation methods:**

| Method | Description | Time |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Streetrat** | Pre-built stat & skill templates. Fastest way to get playing. | ~15 min |
| **Edgerunner** | Rolled stats with 86 skill points to distribute. Balanced control. | ~30 min |
| **Complete Package** | Full control — 62 stat points, 86 skill points, and manual gear purchases. | ~60 min |

**Steps:** Start → Lifepath → Relationships → Stats → Derived → Skills → Gear → Summary

- All 10 roles supported (Rockerboy, Solo, Netrunner, Tech, Medtech, Media, Lawman, Exec, Fixer, Nomad)
- Lifepath tables with roll-or-choose for each entry
- Automatic derived stat calculation (HP, Serious Wound, Death Save, Humanity, Walk/Run)
- Skill point allocation with x2-cost skill tracking
- Role-specific gear presets with alternatives, or manual budget-based purchasing
- Validation checklist on the summary page before final creation
- Creates a fully populated actor with all stats, skills, equipment, and cyberware

Access via the **Character Creator** button in the Actors sidebar.

## NPC Generator

Instantly create combat-ready NPCs from pre-built templates organized by category — or build and import your own.

![NPC Generator](docs/npc.png)

**Categories** are GM-editable: add, rename, reorder, or remove groups via **Module Settings → NPC Categories**. Templates whose category is removed appear under **Uncategorized**. The default categories are Amateur, Competent, Elite, Mini Boss, and Nightmare Boss — but any structure works.

Each template includes pre-configured stats, armor, weapons, skills, cyberware, and equipment. Search and filter by category, preview the full stat block, override the name, pick gear alternatives, and choose between **Mook** or **Character** actor type before creating.

**Custom templates:**
- Start from a **New Blank Template** or **Save as Custom** from any built-in, then refine it in a multi-step editor (basics, combat, skills, extras)
- **Edit** and **Delete** your custom templates
- **Export** and **Import** custom templates as JSON to share them between worlds

**Import from Statblock:**

![Import from Statblock](docs/importer.png)

Paste a Cyberpunk RED NPC statblock directly from the sourcebook (English or Polish) and the parser turns it into a full template automatically.

**How it works:**

1. **Paste** — Drop the raw statblock text into the import dialog
2. **Parse** — The parser detects sections (Stats, HP, Armor, Weapons, Skills, Equipment) and maps each term to its exact compendium entry
3. **Preview** — Review the result: stats, armor, weapons, skills, cyberware, equipment, and role ability; warnings flag anything unrecognized or ambiguous
4. **Create or Save** — Hit **Create NPC** to spawn the actor immediately, or **Save as Template** to add it to your custom template list for repeated use

**What gets parsed:**

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Stats | INT, REF, DEX, TECH, COOL, WILL, LUCK, MOVE, BODY, EMP plus HP, Serious Wound threshold, Death Save |
| Armor | Head and body SP values mapped to compendium armor items |
| Weapons | Matched by name to compendium weapons; quality prefix detected (Poor / Standard / Excellent) |
| Skills | Matched against actor skills; level calculated from the linked stat |
| Cyberware | Cyberweapons (Rippers, Wolvers, etc.) routed to cyberware rather than weapons |
| Equipment & Ammo | Matched to gear and ammo compendium packs |
| Role Ability | Leading bold ability (e.g. *Interface 4*) resolved to role item and rank |

After parsing, the GM selects a category for the imported template in the preview dialog (defaults to Uncategorized). No category is inferred automatically from HP.

Access via the **NPC Template** button in the Actors sidebar.

## Improvement

Spend a character's **Improvement Points (IP)** to raise skills and roles, with a planning cart that lets you stage changes and see the full cost before committing.

![Improvement](docs/improvement.png)

- **Skills** grouped by category (Awareness, Body, Control, …) with a filter box; **+/−** to stage level changes
- **Roles** raised by rank alongside skills
- IP costs follow Cyberpunk RED Core (p. 134): skills cost `20 × next level` (`40 ×` for Difficult skills), roles cost `60 × next rank`
- A running **Planned** banner and `IP: before → after` footer show the net spend before you apply
- **Reset cart** to clear staged changes, **Cancel** to close, or **Apply** to commit them to the actor
- Presence awareness warns when another user has the same character's Improvement window open

Access via the **Improvement** button at the bottom of the Actors sidebar (available to the GM and to players with an assigned character).

## Store

A shared shopping interface where players browse and buy equipment from the system's compendium packs. Purchases are deducted from the character's Eurodollars automatically.

![Store — Player View](docs/store.png)

**Player features:**
- Browse items by category: Ammo, Armor, Clothing, Cyberware, Gear, Programs, Upgrades, Vehicles, Weapons
- Search across all items
- Items grouped by source (Core, Black Chrome, DLC, World)
- Buy with confirmation dialog showing balance before and after

**GM controls** (settings tab inside the Store):

![Store — GM Settings](docs/store-gm.png)

- **Cost modifier** — adjust all prices globally (percentage-based, or set to free)
- **Price range filter** — restrict which items are visible by price
- **Category availability** — enable/disable entire item categories
- **Hide individual items** — remove specific items from the store
- **Exclude compendium packs** — hide entire packs (configured in module settings)
- **Loot mode** — GMs can add items to characters for free

Access via the **Store** button in the Items sidebar.
